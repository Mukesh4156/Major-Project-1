<p>Madhubani art (also Mithila art) is a style of painting practiced in
the Mithila region of India and Nepal. It is named<br> after the Madhubani
district of Bihar, India, which is where it originated. Artists create
these paintings using a variety<br> of mediums, including their own fingers, or twigs, brushes, nib-pens, and matchstick.
 The paint is created using<br> natural dyes and pigments.
 The paintings are characterised by their eye-catching geometrical patterns.
 There is<br> ritual content for particular occasions, such as birth or marriage, and festivals, such as Holi, Surya Shasti,
 Kali Puja,<br> Upanayana, and Durga Puja.</p>
 <h3>Origin and tradition</h3>
 <p>Madhubani painting (or Mithila painting) was traditionally created by the women of various communities in the Mithila<br>
 region of the Indian subcontinent. It originated from Madhubani district of the Mithila region of Bihar.
 Madhubani is<br> also a major export center of these paintings.
 [1] This painting as a form of wall art was practiced widely throughout<br> the region; the more recent development of painting on 
 paper and canvas mainly originated among the villages<br> around Madhubani, and it is these latter developments that
 led to the term "Madhubani art" being used alongside<br> "Mithila Painting."[2]<br><br>
 The paintings were traditionally done on freshly plastered mud walls and floors of huts, but now they are also done<br> on cloth,
 handmade paper and canvas.[3] Madhubani paintings are made from the paste of powdered rice.<br> 
 Madhubani painting has remained confined to a compact geographical area and the skills have been passed on through centuries,
 the content and the<br>  style have largely remained the same. Thus, Madhubani painting has received GI (Geographical Indication) status. 
 Madhubani paintings use two<br> -dimensional imagery, and the colors used are derived from plants.
 Ochre, Lampblack and Red are used for reddish-brown and black, respectively.<br> [citation needed]</p>
 <h3>Symbols</h3>
 <p>Mithila paintings mostly depict people and their association with nature and scenes and deities from the ancient epics.
 Natural objects like the sun, the<br> moon, and religious plants like tulsi are also widely painted, 
 along with scenes from the royal court and social events like weddings. In this paintings<br>  generally, no space is left empty;
 the gaps are filled by paintings of flowers, animals, birds, and even geometric designs.
 [citation needed] Traditionally, painting <br> was one of the skills that was passed down from generation to generation
 in the families of the Mithila Region, mainly by women .
 [4] It is still practiced <br> and kept alive in institutions spread across the Mithila region. 
 Asha Jha of Madhubanipaints in Darbhanga,[5] Vaidehi in Madhubani, Benipatti in Madhubani<br>  district and Gram Vikas Parishad 
 in Ranti are some of the major centres of Madhubani painting which have kept this ancient art form alive</p>
 <h3>Styles</h3>
 <p>Mithila art has five distinctive styles:<br>
 1.Bharni<br>
 2.Katchni<br>
 3.Tantrik<br>
 4.Godna<br>
 5.Kohbar</p>
 <P>In the 1960s Bharni, and Tantrik styles were mainly done by Brahman women in India and Nepal.
 Their themes<br>  were mainly religious and they depicted Gods and Goddesses paintings.
 People of other castes included aspects <br> of their daily life and symbols, the story of Raja Shailesh (guard of the village)
 and much more, in their paintings. Nowadays Madhubani art has become a <br> globalised art form, so there is no difference in the
 work on the basis of the caste system. They work in all five styles. Mithila art has received worldwide<br>  attention.[6][7]</p>
 <h3>Contributions</h3>
<p>The Madhubani painting tradition played a key role in the conservation efforts in India in 2012,
 where there was frequent deforestation in the state of Bihar.<br>  
 Gram Vikas Parishad, an NGO, started the initiative as an attempt to protect local trees that were being cut down in the
 name of expanding roads and <br> development. The main reason behind this was that the trees were traditionally
 adorned with forms of gods and other religious and spiritual images such <br> as those of Radha-Krishna, Rama-Sita, 
 scenes from Ramayana and Mahabharata and other mythologies.[citation needed]</p>
 <h3>Awards</h3>
 <p>Madhubani painting received official recognition in 1969 when Sita Devi received the State award by Government of Bihar.
 Mamta Devi from the village <br> Jitwarpur has also got National Award. Jagdamba Devi from Bhajparaul,
 Madhubani was given Padma Shri in 1975 and the National Award to Sita Devi of<br>  Jitwarpur village near Madhubani.
 [8][9] Jagdamba Devi's foster son Satya Narayan Lal Karn and his wife Moti Karn are also well-regarded Mithila artists,<br> 
 and they won the National Award jointly in 2003. Sita Devi received the Padma Shri in 1981.
 Sita Devi was also awarded by Bihar Ratna in 1984 and Shilp<br>  Guru in 2006.</p>
 <p>In 1984 Ganga Devi was awarded by Padma Shri.[10][11] Mahasundari Devi received the Padma Shri in 2011.
 Baua Devi, Yamuna Devi, Shanti Devi,<br>  Chano Devi, Bindeshwari Devi, Chandrakala Devi, Shashi kala Devi, Leela Devi,
 Godavari Dutta, Asha Jha and Bharti Dayal were also given the National<br>  award.[12][13][14] Chandrabhushan (Rasidpur), Ambika Devi
 (Rasidpur), Manisha Jha were also given the National award.[citation needed]
 In 2020, Madhubani<br>  artist Dulari Devi won the Padma Shri for contributions to art.[15]</p>
